# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
Data Source: election results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code, 1.2.3

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

The candidates were:

Candidate 1:Charles Casper Stockham

Candidate 2:Diana DeGette

Candidate 3:Raymon Anthony Doane


The candidate results were:

Candidate 1:Charles Casper Stockham, received 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes

Candidate 2:Diana DeGette received, 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

Candidate 3:Raymon Anthony Doane ,received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

The winner of the election was:
Candidate 2:Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The challenge revolved around writing a python script to show the election result by running an election audit ,as what is expected by the Colorado Board of Elections employee and then writing the election results to a text file, in order to have a clear glance on the election results. It will make things more convenient, as for someone to just know the results by looking at the text file and not inspecting and looking at the code all over again,it is quite time saving. 

## Challenge Summary
Through this challenge, it was found evident that the Candidate 2: Diana DeGette, won the election by receiving 73.8% votes. This analysis was possible by using functions such as 'for' to iterate through the data and knowing the total votes. Furthermore, using an 'if' function to check certain conditions. At the end using the 'print' function to print the results to the terminal. 

Taking one step further, by writing the outcomes to a text file by using the function 'write', in order to make the results readable for everyone without going through the code again and again.
